lvl 18 : This level is intresting cause it will help you to understand that using ssh you not only can make a connection but also give commands within the same line.
This is helpful in this level as the .bashrc file is changed in such a way that it doesn't let us remotely login.
 .bashrc is basically a script which is executed whenever a user logs in. It can be configured.


Command used : 
 ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
