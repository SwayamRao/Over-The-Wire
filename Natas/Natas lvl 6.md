In this level we first get a query to submit.
Now we go to the source code given in the website.
By looking at the source code we can understand that it is using php.
{As php starts from <? and ends with <? }.
Now we can see that it is using a file called include/secret.inc.
Now we use this to go access the file using the concept of relative paths.
After accessing the file we get a blank screen but here we need to inspect and get the value of secret.

Secret : FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU

Now use this value of secret and submit the query to get the Password for next level.
