For this lvl we use burp suite.
We first see that the message has '' which when refreshed changes to the url of previous website.
This is beacuse of the header 'referer'.
There is a url given below to understand the header referer.
Now we start our burp suite to intercept the request and modify them.
We go in proxy tab and we use intercept in 'on' mode.
Intercept basically is used to intercept the requests sent the browser and to change or modify them.
Now change the value of refer to the given permited url and forward it.
You will get the password.
